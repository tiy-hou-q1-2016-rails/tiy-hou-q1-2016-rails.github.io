# Recommended work before class

I ask that you complete each of these exercises before the first day of class.
They will ensure you're a step ahead and we can get to the good stuff quickly.
It should take you three hours or so total to work through the mandatory ones.

* Complete the first four levels of [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org).
* Complete the [Try Git walkthrough](https://try.github.io).
* Complete the first 6 chapters of [Eloquent Ruby](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/web-development/ruby/9780321700308).
