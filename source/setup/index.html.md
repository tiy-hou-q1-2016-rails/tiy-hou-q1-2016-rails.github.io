# Optimal Setup

All you need to install for the first week:

* [Atom](/setup/atom.html) our free editor from GitHub
* [XCode](/setup/xcode.html)
* [Homebrew](/setup/homebrew.html)
* Install Google Chrome ([download](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/))

Last semester we tried to install everything upfront. This one, we'll attempt to do it on as on-needed basis.
